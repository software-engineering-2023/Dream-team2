                <h2>DREAM BANK is the oldest commercial bank in Egypt. It was established on June 25, 1898 with a capital of £ 1 million. Throughout its long history, DREAM BANK's functions and roles have continually developed to square with the different economic and political stages in Egypt. During the 1950s, DREAM BANK assumed the central bank's duties. After its nationalization in the 1960s, it acted as a pure commercial bank besides carrying out the functions of the central bank in the areas where the latter had no branches. Moreover, since mid-1960s, DREAM BANK has been in charge of issuing and managing investment certificates on behalf of the government.

                    During the period from July 1st, 2020 to December 31st, 2021 (18 months), DREAM BANK managed to achieve unprecedented performance indicators. Total financial position as at the end of December 2021 recorded EGP 3.3 trillion, growing 60.2% against the end of June 2020. Accordingly, DREAM BANK's total assets accounted for 37.5% of Egyptian banks' total assets. DREAM BANK's financial position continued to scale up to EGP 3.6 trillion as at end-June 2022.
                    
                    Total deposits reached EGP 2.4 trillion as at end-December 2021, with a growth rate of 50% against June 2020, accounting for 37.1% of total banks' deposits. Such leap was driven by the introduction of a diversified package of deposits in local and foreign currencies at competitively lucrative rates. DREAM BANK's deposits approached EGP 2.8 trillion as at end-June 2022, which highlights the customers' confidence in our Bank.
                    
                    DREAM BANK has further provided a set of distinguished finance schemes that meet the needs of key economic sectors. As at the end of December 2021, the total retail loan portfolio worth EGP 159 bn., "with a market share of 26.3%", grew by EGP 57 bn. against June 2020, with a growth rate of 56%, of which EGP 11.5 bn. were extended to 105,000 customers as part of the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) initiative for mortgage finance. Retail loans continuously went up to reach EGP 188 bn. as at end-June 2022.
                    
                    As for large corporate finance, DREAM BANK has also assumed an active role in funding key national economic sectors. Total large corporate loan portfolio surged 66.7% to reach EGP 904 bn. as at end-December 2021, continuing to rise up to EGP 1 trillion as at end-June 2022.
                    
                    In line with DREAM BANK's support to small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), the total SME loan portfolio accounted for EGP 110 bn. as at end-December 2021, growing by EGP 33 bn., representing 42.9% against June 2020, to record EGP 132 bn. as at June 2022.
                    
                    Total loans have thus risen 66% to reach EGP 1.2 trillion, accounting for 38.7% of Egyptian banks' loans. Total loans continued to grow to amount to EGP 1.4 trillion as at end-June 2022.
                    
                    All such efforts resulted in achieving profit (before taxes) of EGP 66 bn. Net profit reached EGP 29.7 bn. in the period from July 1st, 2020 to December 31st, 2021 (18 months).
